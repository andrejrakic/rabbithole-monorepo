### What might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?

The Wrapped NFT (Non-Fungible Token) pattern is a design pattern in Ethereum smart contracts where you essentially create a new token that represents ownership of the original NFT, but with added functionality or adherence to different standards.

#### Cross-Chain Interoperability

One of the most compelling uses of wrapped NFTs is to facilitate cross-chain interoperability. NFTs from one chain to be "wrapped" and moved to another using Chainlink CCIP.

#### Fractional Ownership

By wrapping an NFT into multiple, fungible tokens, owners can sell percentages of their assets to several buyers, enhancing liquidity and making high-value NFTs accessible to a broader audience.

#### DeFi

Also fractions of NFTs can be used in DeFi for various different purposes, like collateral, for staking, etc.
